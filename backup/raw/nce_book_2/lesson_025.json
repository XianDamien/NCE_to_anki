    "english": "I arrived in London at last. The railway station was big, black and dark. I did not know the way to my hotel, so I asked a porter.\nI not only spoke English very carefully, but very clearly as well. The porter, however, could not understand me. I repeated my question several times and at last he understood. he answered me, but he spoke neither slowly nor clearly.\n'I am a foreigner,' I said.\nThen he spoke slowly, but I could not understand him.\nMy teacher never spoke English like that!\nThe porter and I looked at each other and smiled. Then he said something and I understood it. 'You'll soon learn English!' he said.\nI wonder. In England, each person speaks a different language. The English understand each other, but I don't understand them! Do they speak English?",
