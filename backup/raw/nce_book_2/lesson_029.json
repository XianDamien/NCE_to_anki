    "english": "Captain Ben Fawcett has bought an unusual taxi and has begun a new service. The 'taxi' is a small Swiss aeroplane called a 'Pilatus Porter'. This wonderful plane can carry seven passengers.\nThe most surprising thing about it, however, is that it can land anywhere: on snow, water, or even on a ploughed field.\nCaptain Fawcett's first passenger was a doctor who flew from Birmingham to a lonely village in the Welsh mountains. Since then, Captain Fawcett has flown passengers to many unusual places.\nOnce he landed on the roof of a block of flats and on another occasion, he landed in a deserted car park.\nCaptain Fawcett has just refused a strange request from a businessman. The man wanted to fly to Rockall, a lonely island in the Atlantic Ocean, but Captain Fawcett did not take him because the trip was too dangerous.",
