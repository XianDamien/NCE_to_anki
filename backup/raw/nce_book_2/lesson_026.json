    "english": "I am an art student and I paint a lot of pictures. Many people pretend that they understand modern art. They always tell you what a picture is 'about'. Of course, many pictures are not 'about' anything. They are just pretty patterns. We like them in the same way that we like pretty curtain material. I think that young children often appreciate modern pictures better than anyone else. They notice more. My sister is only seven, but she always tells me whether my pictures are good or not. She came into my room yesterday.\n'What are you doing?' she asked.\n'I'm hanging this picture on the wall,' I answered. 'It's a new one. Do you like it?'\nShe looked at it critically for a moment. 'It's all right,' she said, 'but isn't it upside down?'\nI looked at it again. She was right! It was!",
    "chinese": "我是个学艺术的学生，画了很多画。有很多人装成很懂现代艺术的样子， 总是告诉你一幅画的“意思”是什么。当然， 有很多画是什么“意思”也没有的。它们就是些好看的图案， 我们喜爱它们就像我们喜欢漂亮的窗帘布一样。 我觉得小孩子们往往比任何人都更能欣赏现代绘画， 他们观察到的东西更多。我的妹妹只有7岁，但她总能说出我的画是好还是坏。昨天她到我房里来了。\n\"你在做什么？\"她问。\n\"我正在把画挂在墙上” 我回答到。“这是一副新画，喜欢吗？”\n她带着批评的眼光看了一会儿， “挺好的”，她说，“不过是不是挂反了？“\n我再看了一下，她说的对，的确是挂反了！",
