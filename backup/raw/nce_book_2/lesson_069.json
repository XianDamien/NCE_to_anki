    "english": "I was being tested for a driving licence for the third time. I had been asked to drive in heavy traffic and had done so successfully.\nAfter having been instructed to drive out of town, I began to acquire confidence. Sure that I had passed, I was almost beginning to enjoy my test.\nThe examiner must have been pleased with my performance, for he smiled and said. 'Just one more thing, Mr.Eames. Let us suppose that a child suddenly crosses the road in front of you. As soon as I tap on the window, you must stop within five feet.'\nI continued driving and after some time, the examiner tapped loudly, Though the sound could be heard clearly, it took me a long time to react. I suddenly pressed the brake pedal and we were both thrown forward.\nThe examiner looked at me sadly. 'Mr.Eames,' he said, in a mournful voice, 'you have just killed that child!'",
